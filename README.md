# MineField
This programm emulates well-known game from Microsoft `Mine field`. 

# Controls
Left mouse button to reveal the tile. Right mouse button to place/remove a flag.

# Field specs
In the code you can change variables `fieldSize` and `minesNum` to adjust field size and amount of mines. Do not place too much mines, because the programm can end in an endless loop trying to place mines not to game over on the first move.
